##  Project Overview
This project focuses on distinguishing drones from birds in sky images using deep learning.  
The model is trained on publicly available drone detection datasets combined with sky/bird images.  
It applies **YOLOv8** (for detection) and/or **EfficientNet** (for classification) to identify small flying objects in challenging conditions.
